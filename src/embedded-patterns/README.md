# 4. Embedded-Specific Patterns

This section consolidates all Rust patterns specific to embedded development, focusing on no-std programming, hardware interaction, and real-time constraints essential for embedded cryptography. All scattered content has been unified into this comprehensive reference.

For quick syntax references, see the [Quick Reference](../quick-reference/README.md) section. For foundational concepts, review [Core Language Concepts](../core-concepts/README.md).
