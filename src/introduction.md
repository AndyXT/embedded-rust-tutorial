# Embedded Rust Tutorial for Cryptography Engineers

*A streamlined guide for experienced embedded cryptography C programmers transitioning to Rust*

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Code Examples and Compilation**
> 
> All code examples in this book are written for **ARM Cortex-R5** with `no_std` (no standard library) and no heap allocation. The web-based Rust Playground cannot compile these examples. To run the examples:
> 
> 1. **Copy the code** using the copy button
> 2. **Set up a local Cortex-R5 project** (see [Environment Setup](environment-setup/README.md))
> 3. **Build with**: `cargo build --target armv7r-none-eabi --release`
> 
> Each example is complete and will compile when proper dependencies are added to `Cargo.toml`.

As an experienced embedded cryptography engineer, you understand the critical importance of correctness and security in cryptographic implementations. A single buffer overflow, timing leak, or use-after-free can compromise an entire system. Traditional C development requires constant vigilance against these threats while managing the complexities of embedded systems.

Rust addresses these challenges while maintaining the performance and control essential for cryptographic operations. This tutorial is specifically designed for experienced C programmers who need to become productive in Rust quickly, without wading through basic programming concepts.

## üöÄ Quick Start Navigation

**For immediate productivity:** Jump directly to [Quick Reference](quick-reference/README.md) for C-to-Rust lookup tables.

**For systematic learning:** Follow the linear path: [Environment Setup](environment-setup/README.md) ‚Üí [Core Concepts](core-concepts/README.md) ‚Üí [Embedded Patterns](embedded-patterns/README.md) ‚Üí [Crypto Implementation](cryptography/README.md)

**For specific needs:** Use the navigation sidebar or search functionality to find specific topics.

- **Compile-time prevention of common crypto vulnerabilities** - Catch bugs before they ship
- **Clear boundaries between safe and unsafe code** - Minimize attack surface

## üìö Book Structure

This book is organized into six main sections:

1. **[Quick Reference](quick-reference/README.md)** - Immediate lookup tables for C-to-Rust translations
2. **[Environment Setup](environment-setup/README.md)** - Get your development environment configured
3. **[Core Language Concepts](core-concepts/README.md)** - Understand Rust's fundamental differences from C
4. **[Embedded-Specific Patterns](embedded-patterns/README.md)** - Learn embedded Rust development patterns
5. **[Cryptography Implementation](cryptography/README.md)** - Advanced patterns for secure crypto code
6. **[Migration and Integration](migration/README.md)** - Practical strategies for adopting Rust

Each section builds upon previous knowledge but can also be used independently for reference.
