# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing and improving an existing embedded Rust tutorial document specifically designed for experienced embedded cryptography C programmers. The document currently contains valuable information but suffers from repetitive content, unclear organization, and lacks the focused, quick-reference approach needed for experienced developers transitioning from C to Rust.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an experienced embedded cryptography C programmer, I want a streamlined tutorial that quickly gets me productive in Rust without redundant explanations, so that I can transition efficiently without wading through repetitive content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the document is reorganized THEN it SHALL eliminate redundant explanations that appear in multiple sections
2. WHEN content is consolidated THEN the document SHALL maintain all essential technical information
3. WHEN sections are restructured THEN related concepts SHALL be grouped logically together
4. IF content appears in multiple places THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the most appropriate section with cross-references

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an embedded cryptography engineer familiar with C, I want a quick-reference focused approach that emphasizes practical differences and gotchas, so that I can quickly understand how to apply my existing knowledge in Rust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is restructured THEN it SHALL prioritize practical examples over theoretical explanations
2. WHEN C-to-Rust comparisons are made THEN they SHALL focus on actionable differences rather than general concepts
3. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL be directly applicable to embedded cryptography use cases
4. WHEN concepts are explained THEN they SHALL assume C programming expertise and build upon that foundation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with embedded systems, I want the document to have clear, logical flow from setup to advanced topics, so that I can follow a structured learning path without jumping between unrelated sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the document is organized THEN it SHALL follow a logical progression from basic setup to advanced concepts
2. WHEN sections are ordered THEN each section SHALL build upon knowledge from previous sections
3. WHEN topics are grouped THEN related concepts SHALL be placed in proximity to each other
4. WHEN cross-references are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly marked and easily navigable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an embedded cryptography programmer, I want the document to be concise and focused on essential information, so that I can quickly find what I need without reading through verbose explanations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is edited THEN verbose explanations SHALL be condensed to essential points
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL be minimal but complete
3. WHEN sections are written THEN they SHALL focus on actionable information over background theory
4. WHEN the document is complete THEN it SHALL serve as both a tutorial and quick reference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer transitioning from C to Rust, I want clear identification of critical differences and potential pitfalls, so that I can avoid common mistakes and understand where Rust fundamentally differs from C.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical differences are explained THEN they SHALL be clearly highlighted and emphasized
2. WHEN potential pitfalls are identified THEN they SHALL include specific examples of what to avoid
3. WHEN Rust-specific concepts are introduced THEN they SHALL explain why they matter for embedded cryptography
4. WHEN safety features are discussed THEN they SHALL relate to common C vulnerabilities in crypto code
