# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the reorganization and improvement of the embedded Rust tutorial document to better serve experienced embedded cryptography C programmers. The current document contains valuable information but suffers from repetitive content, unclear organization, and lacks the focused approach needed for experienced developers.

The redesigned tutorial will follow a streamlined structure that eliminates redundancy, emphasizes practical differences between C and Rust, and provides a clear learning progression from basic setup to advanced embedded cryptography concepts.

## Architecture

### Document Structure Redesign

The tutorial will be restructured into three main architectural layers:

1. **Quick Start Layer** - Immediate productivity for C programmers
2. **Core Concepts Layer** - Essential Rust concepts with C comparisons  
3. **Advanced Implementation Layer** - Complex embedded cryptography patterns

### Content Organization Strategy

**Consolidation Approach:**
- Identify and merge duplicate content across sections
- Create a single authoritative section for each concept
- Use cross-references instead of repetition
- Maintain a clear hierarchy of information

**Reference-First Design:**
- Lead with practical quick-reference materials
- Follow with detailed explanations only when necessary
- Prioritize code examples over theoretical discussions
- Structure content for both linear reading and random access

## Data Models

### Content Classification System

```rust
enum ContentType {
    QuickReference,     // Tables, cheat sheets, immediate lookup
    Concept,           // Core language or domain concepts
    Pattern,           // Reusable code patterns and idioms
    Example,           // Complete working examples
    Migration,         // Transition guidance from C
    Security,          // Security-specific considerations
    TypeSystem,        // Advanced type system features (enums, traits, methods)
    Functional,        // Functional programming concepts (iterators, closures)
    Mathematics,       // Math operations and safety considerations
}

enum AudienceLevel {
    Immediate,         // Can be used right away
    Foundational,      // Builds on previous concepts
    Advanced,          // Requires deep understanding
}

struct ContentSection {
    title: String,
    content_type: ContentType,
    audience_level: AudienceLevel,
    prerequisites: Vec<String>,
    c_equivalents: Vec<String>,
    security_notes: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Cross-Reference System

```rust
struct CrossReference {
    source_section: String,
    target_section: String,
    reference_type: ReferenceType,
    context: String,
}

enum ReferenceType {
    SeeAlso,           // Related information
    Prerequisite,      // Must read first
    DetailedIn,        // More details available
    ExampleIn,         // Example usage shown
}
```

## Error Handling

### Content Quality Assurance

**Redundancy Detection:**
- Automated scanning for duplicate content blocks
- Cross-reference validation to ensure targets exist
- Consistency checking for terminology and examples

**Completeness Validation:**
- Ensure all C concepts have Rust equivalents covered
- Verify all code examples compile and run
- Check that security considerations are addressed

**User Experience Validation:**
- Verify logical flow between sections
- Ensure prerequisites are met before advanced topics
- Validate that quick references are truly quick

### Migration Risk Mitigation

**Content Preservation:**
- Maintain all essential technical information during reorganization
- Preserve working code examples
- Keep security-critical information prominent

**Accessibility Assurance:**
- Ensure content remains accessible to target audience
- Maintain multiple access paths (linear and reference-based)
- Preserve ability to use document as both tutorial and reference

## Testing Strategy

### Content Validation Testing

**Technical Accuracy:**
- Compile and test all code examples
- Verify hardware-specific configurations on target platforms
- Validate crypto implementations for correctness

**Usability Testing:**
- Test document flow with sample learning paths
- Verify quick-reference sections provide immediate value
- Ensure C programmers can find equivalent Rust patterns quickly

**Completeness Testing:**
- Map all original content to new structure
- Verify no essential information is lost
- Ensure all requirements are addressed in final structure

### Quality Assurance Process

**Content Review Phases:**
1. **Structure Review** - Verify logical organization and flow
2. **Technical Review** - Validate all code examples and technical content  
3. **Audience Review** - Ensure content serves target audience effectively
4. **Integration Review** - Verify cross-references and navigation work properly

**Validation Criteria:**
- All code examples must compile for specified targets
- Cross-references must resolve correctly
- Content must be non-redundant while remaining complete
- Document must serve both as tutorial and reference

### Performance Considerations

**Document Navigation:**
- Clear table of contents with deep linking
- Section-based organization for quick access
- Minimal scrolling required for related concepts

**Learning Efficiency:**
- Reduced time to productivity for experienced C programmers
- Clear progression path from basic to advanced topics
- Immediate access to practical information without theory overhead
