# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing embedded Rust tutorial from a single markdown document into a structured online book using mdBook. The goal is to create an interactive, navigable web-based book that maintains the tutorial's content while providing better user experience through proper chapter organization, navigation, and web-friendly features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reader of the embedded Rust tutorial, I want the content organized into logical chapters and sections, so that I can easily navigate between topics and find specific information quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is converted THEN it SHALL be split into logical chapters based on topic boundaries
2. WHEN chapters are created THEN each SHALL have a clear title and purpose
3. WHEN the book structure is defined THEN it SHALL follow a logical learning progression
4. WHEN navigation is implemented THEN readers SHALL be able to jump between chapters easily

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer learning embedded Rust, I want an interactive table of contents and search functionality, so that I can quickly locate specific topics or concepts I need to reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mdBook is generated THEN it SHALL include an interactive table of contents
2. WHEN search functionality is available THEN it SHALL allow finding content across all chapters
3. WHEN navigation elements are present THEN they SHALL include previous/next chapter links
4. WHEN the book is accessed THEN it SHALL provide a responsive design for different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As someone hosting or sharing the tutorial, I want the book to be deployable as a static website, so that it can be easily hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the book is built THEN it SHALL generate static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN deployment is configured THEN it SHALL work with common static hosting platforms
3. WHEN the build process is set up THEN it SHALL be reproducible and documented
4. WHEN assets are included THEN they SHALL be properly referenced and bundled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the tutorial, I want the mdBook configuration to support syntax highlighting for Rust code and proper formatting, so that code examples are readable and professional-looking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code blocks are rendered THEN Rust syntax SHALL be properly highlighted
2. WHEN code examples are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain proper formatting and indentation
3. WHEN the book theme is applied THEN it SHALL be professional and readable
4. WHEN code snippets are shown THEN they SHALL support copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a reader progressing through the tutorial, I want clear chapter boundaries and logical content flow, so that I can follow the learning path without confusion about where topics begin and end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is split into chapters THEN each chapter SHALL have a clear scope and purpose
2. WHEN chapter transitions occur THEN they SHALL maintain logical flow and context
3. WHEN cross-references are needed THEN they SHALL use mdBook's linking capabilities
4. WHEN the content is organized THEN it SHALL preserve all existing information without loss

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As someone contributing to or maintaining the tutorial, I want the source files to be well-organized and the build process to be simple, so that updates and contributions can be made easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is created THEN it SHALL follow mdBook conventions and best practices
2. WHEN the build configuration is set up THEN it SHALL be documented and easy to use
3. WHEN source files are organized THEN they SHALL be logically named and structured
4. WHEN the repository is configured THEN it SHALL include proper gitignore and build scripts
