# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves making all Rust code examples in the embedded Rust tutorial compilable and testable, similar to the official Rust book. Currently, the tutorial contains numerous code examples that are not automatically tested for compilation or correctness, which can lead to outdated or broken examples as dependencies and Rust versions evolve. This feature will ensure code quality and provide readers with confidence that all examples work as intended.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reader of the embedded Rust tutorial, I want all code examples to be guaranteed to compile, so that I can trust the examples and copy them into my own projects without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code examples are included in the tutorial THEN they SHALL be automatically tested for compilation
2. WHEN the book is built THEN all Rust code blocks SHALL be validated for syntax correctness
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN code examples SHALL continue to compile successfully
4. WHEN Rust versions change THEN the examples SHALL be verified to work with the target Rust version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the tutorial, I want the build process to catch broken code examples early, so that I can fix issues before they reach readers and maintain high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline runs THEN it SHALL test all code examples for compilation
2. WHEN a code example fails to compile THEN the build process SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN pull requests are submitted THEN code examples SHALL be automatically validated
4. WHEN errors are detected THEN they SHALL provide specific file and line number information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As someone learning embedded Rust, I want code examples to include proper imports and context, so that I can understand the complete picture of how to use the code in real projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL include all necessary imports and dependencies
2. WHEN embedded-specific code is shown THEN it SHALL include appropriate no_std and embedded context
3. WHEN cryptographic examples are given THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and security considerations
4. WHEN code blocks are incomplete THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as snippets with compilation disabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the tutorial examples, I want the code to be runnable in an embedded context where possible, so that I can test the examples on actual hardware or simulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examples are suitable for embedded execution THEN they SHALL be configured to compile for embedded targets
2. WHEN hardware-specific code is included THEN it SHALL be properly feature-gated for different platforms
3. WHEN no_std examples are provided THEN they SHALL compile without the standard library
4. WHEN platform-specific code is shown THEN it SHALL include appropriate conditional compilation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a contributor to the tutorial, I want a clear system for marking code examples that should or shouldn't be compiled, so that I can control which examples are tested while maintaining flexibility for pseudo-code or incomplete examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code examples should not be compiled THEN they SHALL be clearly marked with appropriate attributes
2. WHEN pseudo-code or incomplete examples are needed THEN they SHALL use proper mdBook annotations
3. WHEN examples require specific features or dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly configured
4. WHEN compilation attributes are used THEN they SHALL be documented and consistent across the tutorial

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As someone using the tutorial for reference, I want code examples to demonstrate best practices for embedded cryptography, so that I can learn proper patterns and avoid common security mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cryptographic code is shown THEN it SHALL demonstrate secure coding practices
2. WHEN memory management examples are provided THEN they SHALL show proper zeroization and cleanup
3. WHEN error handling is demonstrated THEN it SHALL follow embedded Rust best practices
4. WHEN concurrent code is shown THEN it SHALL demonstrate safe embedded concurrency patterns
