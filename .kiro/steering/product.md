# Product Overview

## What This Is

An mdBook tutorial specifically designed for experienced embedded cryptography C programmers transitioning to Rust. The book focuses on ARM Cortex-R5 development with `no_std` (no standard library) and no heap allocation.

## Target Audience

- Experienced embedded C programmers (assumes C expertise)
- Cryptography engineers working on embedded systems
- Security-focused developers
- ARM Cortex-R5/M developers

## Key Differentiators

- **No basic programming explanations** - Assumes deep C knowledge
- **Crypto-focused examples** - All examples relevant to cryptographic engineering
- **Quick reference first** - Immediate productivity through comprehensive lookup tables
- **Embedded-specific** - Covers no_std, hardware integration, and real-time constraints
- **Production-ready examples** - Copy-paste ready code for Cortex-R5

## Content Structure

The book is organized into 6 main sections:
1. Quick Reference - C-to-Rust lookup tables
2. Environment Setup - Development environment configuration
3. Core Language Concepts - Rust fundamentals for C programmers
4. Embedded-Specific Patterns - no_std development patterns
5. Cryptography Implementation - Secure crypto code patterns
6. Migration and Integration - Practical adoption strategies

## Learning Paths

- **Quick Productivity** (30 min) - Essential syntax and gotchas
- **Systematic Foundation** (2-3 hours) - Complete foundation
- **Crypto-Focused Deep Dive** (4-6 hours) - Advanced crypto patterns
- **Specific Topic Focus** - Memory safety, hardware integration, secure implementation
